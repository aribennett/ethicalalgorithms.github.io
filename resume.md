## Software
Developed a linux platform used for a kiosk put into nationwide service, building out services managing communications, robotic controls, software deployment, firmware over the air, user interaction, observability and analytics. Developed tools and underlying architecture for operation of a distributed fleet of machines, and well as the data model to enable continuous improvement to better anticipate customer needs and perform fleetwide prognostics. Integrated numerous other software systems as part of an aquisition, and lead architecture development for the software of a nationally scaled product fleet with a team of engineers. Was responsible for every part of the tech stack, from serverless processes in the cloud serving analytics tools all the way down to implementation of motor controls in firmware on a embedded coproccessor, and every link inbetween.

## Mechatronics
Developed numerous controls systems for various projects, including motor commutation, feedback control, inverse kinematics, toolpathing and path planning to produce various products. Did initial mechanical, electronic, and software prototyping and development, before growing the team and taking over managing the technical requirements and execution of all three disciplines. Ran reliability testing to validate full stack design and built the tests and observability tools require to close the loop and refine products.

## Design

Did novel invention and iteration for a product, taking it through all phases from prototype to scaled manufacturing. Coached introductory and advanced design courses in the Product Realization Lab as a teaching assistant. Instructed student in both how to execute their projects and how to approach ideas from a design standpoint, with an eye for feasibility, value and aesthetic. Taught the use of Product Realization Lab tools for both end use work and rapid prototyping to over 500 students, and developed mastery of the tools through both teaching and practice.
